- this command create database then create entities: symfony console make:entity
- enter table name and properties with its type and length.
- I have created three entities User,Room,Booking
- Booking entity contain reltionship betweeon User ans Room so created properties user,room and in type I have write "relation"->enter and "ManyToOne".this established relation between Booking,User and Room.
 - Done with database creation.
 - then created UserController:symfony console make:controller UserController
 - in index.html.twig file created a navbar containing name ,home and book a room

 ### Day 2:
 - Working on date picker functionality.
 - Fetch room from database with the help of getrepository.
 - creating form is very easy in symfony,we have to instantiate object for  class in controller and set properties according to class.
- I created user form with name,credit and premium number as a properties.
- and its twig file just call {{ form(write name given in controller) }} in my case its form.so i call it as {{ form(form) }}.
